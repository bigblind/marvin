# Non-code contributions

Thank you for taking the time to contribute. There's a lack of non-code contributors in open source projects, so we
really need you! Whether you're writing documentation, writing or translating interface text, designing interfaces, logos
or icons, or anything else, we'll help you get your valuable work into this project.

Just [open an issue](https://github.com/marvin-automator/marvin/issues/new) and we'll help you contribute!

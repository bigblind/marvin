# Reporting bugs

Encountering a bug is annoying, and we want to resolve it as quickly as possible.
Pleas search for similar issues to make sure the bug you've encountered hasn't already been reported.
When submitting an issue to report a bug, answer the following questions:

1. What actions did you take?
2. What did you expect to happen?
3. What actually happened?

# Feature requests

We'd love to know what features you'd like Marvin to have.
Create an issue to discuss your idea with the community.
After we have an idea of whether and how it should be implemented,
we'd love it if you could [contribute the code](code.md) for it,
but don't be afraid to post a feature request that you aren't sure
you can implement.

# Marvin

Marvin is an app to program the web, similar to [IFTTT](ifttt.com) and [Zapier](zapier.com), but **Free**
(in [both senses of the word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre) and **open source**.

This project **DOES NOT YET WORK**, but watch this space if you're interested. I'm getting things up and running,
and will be setting up documentation and contribution guidelines **ASAP**. A task runner, or however you call this cathegory
of apps, requires integration with a lot of services, so I'll never be able to build and maintain this thing alone. I'm
hoping that the community will be willing to help out, and make Marvin awesome.
